# Hello World!

I am **Huzeyfe KIRAN** or, you may call me **Huzo**.

Seemingly we are all here to fulfil one goal. That is to **complete this
assignment**. Yes, another thing to do in this **cough** tedious **cough**
course.

**Some further information about me?**

| Nickname     | Expected Year of Graduation |
| ------------ | ------------                |
| Huzo         | 2034                        |

*Some languages that caused me pain in CSCI3180:*
1. COBOL *(the language dinosaurs programmed in)*
2. Fortran *(the language of spaghetti code)*
3. Perl *(the language that uses dynamic scoping... yes, dynamic scoping)*
4. Prolog *(a powerful language that blows your mind in 2 lines)*
5. ML *(I still don't know why this language is for. Don't tell Jimmy pls.)*

*My biggest goals right now:*
- [x] Finish Milestone1
- [ ] Finish Milestone2
- [ ] Finish Milestone3

Yeah, I think that's it.
